# üéÆ Dusk Till Dawn

**Dusk Till Dawn**

Dusk Till Dawn follows Dusk, a University Student,  who finds himself trapped in his dreams, unable to escape. In this dream-like world, he wanders through the labyrinth haunted by shadow-like entities, each encounter peeling away the silence he‚Äôs built around his regrets.
The player‚Äôs purpose is to guide Dusk through these nights, helping him face the truths he had buried deep. Every step brings him closer to acceptance: By dawn, the question isn‚Äôt Can he survive? But can he let go?
